# Programming-Based-Animations
A compilation of programming based animations that I have made in my spare time while playing around with particle movement and math.

## General Particle
This is a coding foundation for almost all of my particle based animation programs, essentially being a blueprint code that I start off with.

It defines a basic particle class that can hold position, colour, size, velocity and acceleration of a particle and render it on a canvas.
The current particle generation code in the program creates white particles at the center of the window with a random velocity, running at 60 frames per second.
